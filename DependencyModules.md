# Introduction #

The modules in the project depend on the following modules. If they are not present in your execution environment, they will need to be added.

### cElementTree or ElementTree ###

The XML parsing and generation for this library is carried out by ElementTree. There are two versions of Element Tree which work with this library, but I recommend using cElementTree as performance is better than for ElementTree.

If you are using Python version 2.5 or higher, you will not need to install this package separately.

Instructions for downloading and configuring cElementTree can be found here: http://effbot.org/zone/celementtree.htm

### httplib ###

httplib has been part of the core Python library since version 2.0, so it should already be present on your system.

### urllib ###

urllib is also a core Python library, so you should not have to install it.
